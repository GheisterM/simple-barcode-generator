Straightforward PHP EAN-13 barcode Generator

This php scripts generates a simple EAN-13 barcode in less than 100 code lines (If you don't count the comments, of course). It does so following the procedure as found in this page: http://grandzebu.net/informatique/codbar-en/ean13.htm

# Usage

1.- Include in your main script, or copy/paste the content where you need it.

2.- Call the barcode($cod) function, sending the code you want to draw.

3.- See the magic.
